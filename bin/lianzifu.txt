Usage: lianzifu <command [argument]...>...

  The commands are executed in command line order.
  Therefore, everything after --exit is ignored.

Commands:

  --version                                print program version
  --help                                   print this help
  --exit                                   exit the program now
  --clear                                  reset string table state
  --read-ini [ini]                         add prefix/csv from <ini>
  --read-csv [utf]                         add strings from all csv
  --save-map [map]                         save [prefix:]id to <map>
  --save-bin [plt] [ver] [bin] [cmp] [flt] save string table to <bin>
  --read-map [map]                         add [prefix:]id from <map>
  --read-bin [bin]                         add csv/strings from <bin>
  --save-csv                               save strings to all csv

Defaults:

  <ini>  #G3:/ini/loc.ini
  <utf>  1
  <map>  #G3:/lianzifu.csv
  <plt>  x64
  <ver>  6
  <bin>  #G3:/data/compiled/localization/w_strings.bin
  <cmp>  9
  <flt>  *_Text;*_StageDir

Map format:

  The map files are used to restore the string identifiers
  (the binary string table contains only the hash values).

  Map files have to be encoded in UTF-8 (BOM is optional).
  Every non-empty line contains <[prefix:]id>[|...], where
  the prefix is optional (used to select the unpacked CSV,
  defaults to first CSV in loc.ini for unknown id hashes),
  and everything after | will be ignored on read (hashes).

CSV format:

  The first line defines the case-insensitive column names.
  The first row contains the case-insensitive string ids or
  an eight-character, hexadecimal, and case-sensitive hash.

  Without a BOM the encoding is detected based on the first
  two octets (X,0 = UTF-16LE; 0,X = UTF-16BE; X,X = UTF-8).
  This extension to the Genome CSV format has been added to
  simplify the work flow with CSV tools that do not write a
  BOM and could be disabled with --read-csv 0 if necessary.

  Records are separated with a LINE FEED (U+000A), the NULL
  (U+0000) is not allowed, and all CARRIAGE RETURN (U+000D)
  are ignored during read. Record fields are separated with
  VERTICAL LINE (U+007C), there's no field quote character,
  leading and trailing white space is not removed, and only
  the following escape sequences are available:
    "\a"  COMMERCIAL AT (U+0040)
    "\n"  LINE FEED (U+000A)
    "\r"  CARRIAGE RETURN (U+000D)
    "\\"  REVERSE SOLIDUS (U+005C)
    "\v"  VERTICAL LINE (U+007C)
  The latter two are extensions to the Genome CSV format to
  permit encoding of field separators and escape sequences.

Examples:

  create #G3:/data/compiled/localization/w_strings.bin (x64 v6) from CSVs

    lianzifu --read-ini --read-csv --save-bin

  export #G3:/lianzifu.csv from CSVs in #G3:/ini/loc.ini

    lianzifu --read-ini --read-csv --save-map

  unpack #G3:/data/compiled/localization/w_strings.bin with #G3:/lianzifu.csv

    lianzifu --read-map --read-ini --read-bin --save-csv
